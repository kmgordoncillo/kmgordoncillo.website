    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Hi! I’m Kier Mhico C. Gordoncillo, a passionate student currently
        studying Computer Engineering at Asian College Dumaguete. I’m focused on
        building clean, responsive websites and learning the foundations of
        front-end development. My main tools are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I’m
        currently exploring React and UI/UX design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from coding, I enjoy designing layouts, creating digital art, and
        learning new things online. I believe that great design isn’t just about
        how it looks—it’s also about how it works. My goal is to become a
        skilled developer who creates useful, creative, and meaningful digital
        experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm inspired by how technology can solve real-world problems and bring
        ideas to life. Whether it's a small personal project or a group
        collaboration, I always aim to bring creativity, functionality, and
        purpose to my work. I believe that learning never stops—and that every
        challenge is a chance to grow both as a developer and as a person.
      </p>
